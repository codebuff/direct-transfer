             allows you to transfer/share  files over intranet 
             currently the app is coded specially for NU network but in future 
             code will incorporate rules and algorithm to support other 
             networks

          A heartfelt thanks to >> MR SWAMI << for helping me during the designing and developing 
          process without his help I wouldn't have a clue how different protocols work
          
          big thanks to >> Nakul and Lalit << for designing the logo of this app and testing

               which means that I will make sure that this software is developed further 
               but due to college course load it may take some time for me to implement new 
                 features/remove bug etc
